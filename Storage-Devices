# Storage Devices (CompTIA A+ Notes)

## Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
- Uses spinning magnetic platters.
- Higher storage capacity at lower cost.
- Slower performance compared to SSDs.
- More prone to mechanical failure.

## Solid State Drives (SSD)
- No moving parts, uses flash memory.
- Much faster read/write speeds.
- More expensive per GB than HDDs.
- Better durability and energy efficiency.

## NVMe SSD
- Connects directly via PCIe bus.
- Delivers the highest speeds for modern systems.
- Ideal for gaming, servers, and high-performance tasks.

## Flash Drives
- Portable, connects via USB.
- Useful for transferring files.
- Not designed for long-term or heavy storage.

## Optical Media
- CD/DVD/Blu-ray, read with a laser.
- Limited storage compared to modern drives.
- Largely legacy, but still seen in some older systems.
